🧠 Study Log — October 25, 2025
📘 TOEFL Vocabulary of the Day

Today I learned the following words:
petroglyphs, infer, primitive, practical, plausible, divine, boredom, deteriorate, thrive, collapse, epidemic, descendant, revolt, rebellion.

These words help me expand my academic vocabulary and better understand reading passages in TOEFL! ✍️

✏️ Grammar Notes

Here’s what I studied today in English grammar:

If the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular.
→ He studies English every day.

Present perfect: “~해왔다”
→ I have studied English for three years.

After a modal verb, always use the base form of the verb.
→ could think, will go, should study.

For plural nouns, add –s or –es if there are two or more people or things.
→ students, boxes.

Uncountable nouns: water, air, salt.
Abstract nouns: advice, information, traffic.
❌ Don’t use a or an before them!

Each, every, and another must be followed by a noun.
→ each student, every book, another chance.

No “the” before places used for their main purpose:
→ go to school, go to church, go to bed.

Use “the” for things that are one of a kind or unique:
→ the sun, the world, the sea.

Use “the” before superlatives:
→ the best, the fastest, the most beautiful.

📚 These rules are essential for TOEFL writing and grammar accuracy!

🎧 Duolingo Practice

I also practiced listening and finished a project called “Video Call with Sally” on Duolingo.
It helped me improve my pronunciation and confidence while speaking! 🗣️💬

💪 Summary

Overall, today’s study focused on TOEFL writing grammar, vocabulary building, and Duolingo listening practice.
It was a productive and fun day of learning! 🌟
