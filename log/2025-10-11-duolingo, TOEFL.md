## 🧠 Grammar & Expression Notes

- **Gerunds as Subjects**  
  - Example: *Being outdoors is relaxing.*  
  - "Being" turns the action/state into a noun so it can act as the subject.

- **Natural Future Tense Usage**  
  - Prefer “will start operating” or “is set to begin” in formal English.
  - “Is going to operate” is okay in conversation, but can sound less precise.

- **Conditionals**  
  - Structure: *If + present tense*, *will/might + base verb*  
  - Example: *If it rains, we might cancel the event.*

## 🎯 Next Steps / Goals

- Practice using conditional sentences more naturally.
- Review the difference between **gerunds** and **infinitives**.
- Create example sentences with today’s vocabulary.
- Record and review pronunciation and fluency.
